            <p>I am a senior at Wright State University. And will be graduating in July 2016.
            I have enjoyed my time at wright state so far but really have no idea what I want to do 
            for my career. I suppose I will have to just get out there and try a few things to see what 
            I like and am good at.</p>
            <p>I grew up in West Carrollton Ohio my entire education. I hope to move west someday
            maybe Colorado or Califonia.</p>
            <p>I am married and have two children ages 4 and 10 months. They take most of my free 
            time to entertain and enjoy time with. I hope to one day have all sorts of time to spend
            with them without feeling guilty I am not doing homework.</p>
